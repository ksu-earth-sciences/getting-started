# Getting Started

- First Look inside of the image processing repository to find the Setup files. Those files will go over in detail on what is installed and how to install them.
- If you wish, you can go through the tutorial to get the hand of it
## TIFF files
- A TIFF, which stands for Tag Image File Format, is a computer file used to store raster graphics and image information.
- TIFFs are perfect for retaining lots of impressively detailed image data because they use a predominately lossless form of file compression.
- We use them here as GeoTiffs. These can hold data about the geological data around it, including GPS coordinates
## Micasense
- Micasnese makes sensors for drones that are very high quality
- Our image processing repository is a fork from the miscasense image processing repository
- The repository works with understanding a micasense sensor
